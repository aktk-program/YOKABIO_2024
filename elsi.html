            ELSI (Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues) is an important framework
            for anticipating and addressing the social impacts of advanced
            technologies. In particular, ethical, legal, and social issues are
            inevitable in the research, development, and application of new
            biotechnologies such as DNA origami technology. Although this
            technology enables structural design at the nanoscale and is
            expected to have medical and industrial applications, its
            implementation requires careful discussion. Here, we review the ELSI
            issues related to DNA origami technology from ethical, legal, and
            social perspectives, and provide guidelines for the safe and
            appropriate development of the technology.

            Ethical issues in DNA origami technology include the presence or
            absence of genetic information in the DNA used and transparency
            regarding the use of the generative AI. First, if DNA contains
            genetic information, it must be treated as a biohazard and must be
            strictly controlled to prevent the risk of leakage or misuse. In
            addition, there is a risk of inadequate response to problems that
            may arise when designing DNA structures using AI technology, because
            it is difficult to fully understand the design process. In
            particular, it is essential to develop guidelines and ethical
            standards for use and promote appropriate management of AI
            technology, especially for design products using generative AI.
            Legal Issues Legal challenges for DNA origami include: the lack of
            legal provisions for handling of designs created by generative AI,
            the absence of provisions for treating DNA and RNA molecules as
            materials in molecular robotics, and concerns about preventing dual
            use (e.g., military use). Currently, intellectual property rights
            and liability for structures using generative AI are unclear, and
            laws need to be developed as this technology progresses. In
            addition, DNA and RNA molecules used in the field of molecular
            robotics are expected to be used with specific intentions, but it is
            difficult to completely eliminate the risk of misuse, so legal
            prevention measures regarding dual use need to be put in place in
            advance. Furthermore, it is important to assess the impact of the
            technology after it is applied in society over the long term, and to
            establish monitoring and regulatory mechanisms to prevent unforeseen
            impacts on the environment and society.

            Some of the challenges that DNA origami technology poses to society
            include prejudice based on a general lack of understanding and
            misunderstanding, environmental impacts, and equity in the use of
            the technology. The technology is still unfamiliar to the general
            public, which could lead to widespread misunderstanding and
            prejudice against genes and DNA technology. Therefore, there is a
            need to provide accurate information and educate the general public
            about DNA origami technology. In addition, the environmental impact
            of discarded DNA structures when the technology is disseminated
            should also be fully considered. Furthermore, inequality due to the
            economic disparity that could occur when the technology is applied
            is also a concern, and equitable use of the technology should be
            promoted, especially in the medical field.
