          To create DNA origami structures, optimization of conditions is
          necessary. We sought the optimal conditions for the formation of the
          initial structure of Vertex-Switcher, which is the intermediate state.
          The conditions we examined include the length of hinges connecting the
          edges, MgCl2 concentration, and annealing protocol. Fig. 1 illustrates
          the patterns of each condition.<br />
          <img

          />
          <p style="text-align: center">Fig.1 最適条件を探るために試すタイプ</p>
          When the hinge is short, the edge's mobility decreases, but when the
          hinge is long, structural stability is compromised. We experimented
          with three patterns, primarily focused on the minimum hinge length
          required to narrow the angle to 30° (SI Appendix, Section1-4). Mg+
          ions neutralize the negative charges of DNA and contribute to
          structural formation. We tested four different concentrations based on
          previous research [1]. Two annealing protocols were examined, one
          following prior research [1] and another universal for 3D DNA origami
          [2]. We confirmed the products of all 24 patterns using agarose gel
          electrophoresis. In terms of the annealing protocol, since structures
          were successfully formed with either method, we determined that the
          annealing protocol derived from previous research [1] is more
          suitable. The results of annealing protocol 1 are presented in Fig.
          2.<br />

          The electrophoresis results bear similarities to previous research
          [1], suggesting the formation of intermediates. It is presumed that
          the intermediates are located near the 3 kbp region in each lane.
          Multiple bands situated above them are believed to be oligomers that
          formed during the intermediate's assembly process. Furthermore, bands
          below the 1 kbp mark are thought to result from the binding of
          mini-scaffolds (SI Appendix, Section 1-2) and staples to each other.
          In terms of band intensity, lanes with a 3 nt hinge exhibit denser
          bands, and lanes with a 22.5 mM MgCl2 concentration also show
          prominent bands.<br />

          An image containing three internal spaces was observed. The nearly
          straight alignment of Edges 4 and 9 indicates that the central vertex
          is of group X. The presence of X-shaped vertices at the center of the
          structure suggests that the structure adheres to the grid in a manner
          resembling Fig. 5-3. Additionally, the indistinct outlines of edges
          near the image's periphery suggest that edges may overlap during grid
          adhesion.<br />

          <p class="fs-4 mt-3 hleft-line">鎖置換の実証</p>
          The transformation mechanism of the Vertex-Switcher involves altering
          the distance between the edges of the structure through chain
          replacement. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was conducted using
          staples that are involved in chain replacement to demonstrate the
          occurrence of chain replacement. The electrophoresis results are shown
          in Fig.5.<br /><br />

          Chain replacement was observed in both the transformations between the
          intermediate and the 6-vertex structure, and between the intermediate
          and the 8-vertex structure. In samples with the addition of close-DNA,
          bands appear at higher positions due to the binding between close-DNA
          and fastening-DNA. Furthermore, in samples with the addition of
          open-DNA, bands corresponding to waste appear as close-DNA and
          open-DNA bind. However, in the chain replacement for the
          transformation between the intermediate and the 6-vertex structure,
          even with the addition of open-DNA, the bands at higher positions did
          not disappear. Therefore, it is suggested that the 6-vertex structure
          may have difficulty returning to the intermediate state.<br />
          <p class="fs-4 mt-3 hleft-line">中間体から他状態への構造変化の確認</p>
          The Vertex-Switcher undergoes transformation by adding specific ssDNA
          to the intermediate state. The generation of the intermediate state
          was confirmed by TEM. Therefore, under similar conditions, we
          attempted to create the intermediate state once again and added
          close-DNA to explore the production of 6-vertex and 8-vertex
          structures. Intermediate states with hinge lengths of 3nt, 6nt, and
          10nt were generated under Annealing Protocol 1 and a salt
          concentration of 22.5mM, followed by purification using gel excision.
          Gel excision was chosen for purification due to the low yield of
          purification via tangential flow filtration (SI Appendix, Section3-2).
          After purification via gel excision, close-DNA was added. The results
          of agarose gel electrophoresis for each sample are presented in
          Fig.6.<br />
          Regarding the 10nt hinge, the position of the bands in the sample with
          added close-DNA has changed. Therefore, it is believed that structural
          changes are significant in the intermediate state with a 10nt hinge
          when close-DNA is added to this sample, and this sample was observed
          using TEM.<br />

          The Vertex-Switcher for 6-vertex and 8-vertex structures undergoes
          structural changes to an intermediate state by adding specific ssDNA.
          To verify the reversibility of these transformations, we conducted an
          operation to return the previously confirmed 6-vertex hinge 10nt
          structure to the intermediate state by adding open-DNA. The resulting
          structures from this operation were observed using TEM to confirm if
          the 6-vertex structure reverted to the intermediate state.<br />

          We observed structures with edges and vertices. However, the observed
          images display structures distinct from those seen in Fig. 3-a and
          Fig. 4-a. Additionally, in both Fig.8-a and Fig.8-b, unlike the
          deformed 6-vertex structure in Fig. 7, there are gaps between the
          edges. Therefore, it is assumed that only some vertices have been
          opened by open-DNA. There are two conceivable reasons for this.
          Firstly, the non-uniform orientation of the toehold when close-DNA
          binds to fastening-DNA. Fastening-DNA is not uniformly designed due to
          several constraints (SI Appendix, Section1-3). Vertices with toeholds
          that act as footholds to remove close-DNA, oriented towards the
          outside of the structure, are more likely to open, whereas those
          oriented towards the inside of the structure are less likely to open.
          To resolve this issue, it may be necessary to reconsider the design of
          fastening-DNA and the 4 Helix Bundle. Secondly, the chains used for
          the transformation to the 6-vertex structure may not be completely
          removed. The results in Fig. 5 suggest the possibility that the chain
          replacement required for transforming to the 6-vertex structure may
          not have occurred in its entirety. Although we were unable to do so in
          this instance due to time constraints, comparing the samples that were
          transformed to the intermediate state with the 8-vertex structure
          could verify this hypothesis.<br />
