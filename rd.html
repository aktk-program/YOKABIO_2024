          Optimization of structure formation conditions for the formation of
          DNA origami structures increases time and collection efficiency. We
          first searched for optimal structure formation conditions using a
          simple structure without a closing mechanism. We performed experiments
          for optimization by changing the salt concentration and annealing
          conditions. For different salt concentrations, we first confirmed
          formation at different concentrations of Mg²⁺ (12.5 mM~25 mM, in 2.5
          mM increments). Since the charge was possibly too strong at these
          concentrations, Na⁺ 100 mM was added here to study the conditions. In
          addition, to explore lower salt concentrations, experiments were
          conducted using Na⁺ only (0.5 M~2.5 M, in 0.25 M increments). The
          specific salt concentrations used in the experiments were the values
          in Tables 1 through 3. In addition, an annealing protocol of 2 hours
          was initially employed; it was placed at 95 °C for 3 minutes and then
          lowered by 0.6 °C every minute from 95 °C to 20 °C.
          <br />
          After annealing, the different salt concentrations were compared by
          agarose electrophoresis. Electrophoresis was performed in a cold room
          at 50 V, 120 min, 4 °C. The results of the electrophoresis are shown
          in figure 1(a)~(c) below.

          The structure was observed after purification of gel filtration
          method. In the annealing method of protocol 1, the bands of the DNA
          origami structures are located above the bands of the scaffolds. This
          indicates that KIT-D is formed in the 2 hours protocol. In addition,
          the dimer band is clearly visible in the Na⁺-only sample, while the
          dimer band is thin or absent in the Mg²⁺-containing sample. This
          suggests that under monovalent salt conditions, it takes longer for
          the DNA to fold, during which time it may bind to different
          structures. Furthermore, aggregation is more common at concentrated
          concentrations of Mg²⁺ only, especially at 22.5 and 25 mM. From this,
          it can be considered that if the salt concentration is too
          concentrated, the structures would aggregate and the yield would be
          poor. Under the 2 hours annealing condition, there is a lot of smear
          overall, but this is because the purification protocol was not
          established and a method for clean purification was not known. In the
          annealing method of protocol 2, a comparison of various prolonged
          annealing conditions with 17 hours of annealing was performed. As in
          protocol 1, the dimer band is clearly visible in the Na²⁺-only
          condition, but in this annealing method, the dimer band is more
          clearly visible even when annealing with Mg²⁺ is included. This may be
          attributed to the fact that more dimers are formed over time due to
          the increased time spent on annealing; more dimers were formed by
          increasing the time in the 2 hours protocol despite the same salt
          concentration, indicating that the 2 hours protocol did not result in
          a ring shape, but rather a relatively large number of DNA
          nanostructures in an unfolded state DNA nanostructures were relatively
          abundant in the 2h protocol. Aggregation also appears to increase in
          all conditions, regardless of salt concentration, compared to 2 hours.
          This may be due to the fact that, as with the dimer bands, the
          annealing process over time facilitated the separation of DNA
          nanostructures that did not form well. The 17 hours protocol, like the
          2 hours protocol, also shows a lot of smears and extra staple strands,
          but this is because the purification method was not working well at
          this time. The sample was observed and a ring-shaped DNA origami
          structure was successfully identified. The inner diameter of KIT-D
          without latches in the open state, is about 40 nm by calculation, and
          the inner diameter of the DNA nanostructure on the photograph is also
          about 40 nm. Since this structure has six planes, it can be well
          assumed to be derived from KIT-D, which is the target of the study. In
          addition, at this salt concentration, many of the structures were
          found to be banded with a total length of about 140 nm and a width of
          about 20 nm, suggesting that they were off-hinged. By comparing each
          salt concentration condition of the 2h and 17h protocols, it was
          common that the aggregation increased when the salt concentration was
          too high. Given that there is room for improvement in the purification
          method, it was difficult to determine the optimal salt concentration
          from these results, so it was necessary to try different salt
          concentration conditions for the latchable structure. Focusing on the
          borderline where no guirigi-aggregation occurred at each salt
          concentration, we were able to narrow the conditions to Na⁺ 17.5 M,
          Mg²⁺ 20 mM, Mg²⁺ 22.5 mM & Na 100 mM salt concentrations for the
          structure with latch.

            The encircled structure in figure 6 shows a long DNA-like structure
            with a size of about 130 nm, close to that of unfolded, band-shaped
            KIT-D with Mg 22.5 mM, Na 100mM.

          Figure 6 shows a structure with characteristics similar to that of the
          desired structure. Compared to the image of figure 4, figure 6 shows
          more aggregations even after purification. This suggests that unlike
          ring-shaped structures, band-shaped structures are likely to aggregate
          and reduce the yield of the desired structure.

          To compare the difference between open and closed structures, TEM
          imaging was used to compare samples with open and closed states. Since
          the AGE result did not show significant difference between samples
          using a mix of Mg and Na, concentration of Mg 22.5 mM was selected.
          The results are shown in figure 8.

            From Figure 7, it can be suggested that it is likely to form
            aggregations in lower salt concentrations and with low and high salt
            concentrations, bold dimer bands can be observed. Also, bands of
            closed structures are located slightly lower than the open
            structures in most samples, suggesting that closed structures have
            smaller structural size. This is an ideal result for KIT-D, since
            when the structure is in its closed state, it is assumed for the
            structure to fold in, resulting in smaller structural size. From
            Figure 8, there is clearly less aggregation with the closed
            structures, as well as structures forming dimers. It appears that
            closed structures have similar size overall, suggesting the
            possibility of successful KIT-D transformation. However, further
            analysis and verification is required for clearer and reproducible
            results.<br /><br />
