            ). Since KIT-D designed on caDNAno was 7535 bases long, M13mp18
            single-strand with a length of 7560 bases was selected as the
            scaffold strand, and only 25 bases were left over. The total number
            of staple strands used in the KIT-D construct was 250, both with and
            without latches, and were designed with the assumption that six
            identical single-stranded DNA "close" strands would be added to them
            in order to transform them into the closed form. A file containing
            the detailed positions and sequences of these designs can be
            obtained from the following json file.

          Samples were prepared by mixing 15 µL of 400 nM staple strands, 6 µL
          of 100 nM scaffold strands, 6 μL of 10&times; folding buffer which
          consist of 10&times; TE buffer and ten times the final salt
          concentration, the rest with MilliQ for a total of 60 μL. For samples
          with salt concentrations with Na⁺ only, Instead of the 10&times;
          folding buffer, 10&times; TE buffer and the right amount of 5M NaCl
          solution were added.
          <br />Annealing was performed by using Biometra TOne thermal cycler,
          with 60 µL samples aliquoted to three 20 µL samples. During the
          annealing cycle, the samples were first heated to 85 °C, and then
          cooled to 65 °C in 5 minutes, then cooled to 60 °C in 15 minutes, 44
          °C with -1 °C/hr, and to 4 °C with -1 °C/min. After annealing is
          complete, the 20 µL samples were combined to one 60 µL sample.<br />
          Purification of the samples were done with MicroSpin S-300 HR Columns.
          Purification gels were set in the columns in advance. First the
          columns were mixed using a vortex, and then the bottom closure was
          twisted off and the cap was loosened one-quarter. The column was set
          onto a 1.5 mL tube and was centrifuged for 800&times;g for 1 minute.
          100 µL of buffer with the same composition as the sample was loaded
          onto the column and centrifuged at 800&times;g for 1 minute.repeat
          this process twice, and then change the 1.5 mL microtube to a new one
          for retrieval. 50 µL samples were added and were left still for 2
          minutes. The output was collected, and its concentration was measured
          using nanoDrop, and then were compared using agarose gel
          electrophoresis.

          For the agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) analysis, a 1% agarose gel
          (KANTO, Japan) was prepared using 0.5X TBE buffer with an additional 5
          mM MgCl2. The same buffer solution (0.5X TBE with 5 mM MgCl2) was used
          as the running buffer. Electrophoresis was conducted at 50 V for 2
          hours at 4˚C. A 1 kb DNA Ladder (TaKaRa, Japan) was included as a
          reference. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained using SYBR Gold
          (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States) and visualized with the
          WSE-6100H LuminoGraph I (ATTO, Japan).

          solution was applied to the TEM grid and allowed to incubate for 5
          minutes at room temperature. The structures were then stained with 1%
